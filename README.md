**Why did I start this project?**

Being me, I went through some severe mental issues for a very very long time. I will not go on deeply about this, but trust me, I have suffered alot.

Anyway, one day I realized that remembering little bits of happiness that randomly pops up in my daily life helps me feel better. So, I decided to make something so that I can keep track of the things that make me happy by text, and this is how this project started.
